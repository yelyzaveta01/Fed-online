    <h2>Size</h2>
    <p>The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[47] It averages about 46 cm (18
        in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are
        larger than females.[48] Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).</p>
    <h2>Skull</h2>
    <p>The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.[51]: 35 
        Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat
        delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae
        and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.[52] Compared to other felines, domestic
        cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their
        preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.</p>
    <h2>Claws</h2>
    <p>Cats have protractible and retractable claws.[54] In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with
        the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the
        ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on
        the hindfeet.[55] Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in
        hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer
        of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.</p>
    <h2>Ambulation</h2>
    <p>The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible
        leg.[59] Unlike most mammals, it uses a "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the
        legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding
        fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating
        rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally
        opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.</p>
    <h2>Balance</h2>
    <p>Cats are generally fond of sitting in high places or perching. A higher place may serve as a concealed site from
        which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch. Another possible
        explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. A cat
        falling from heights of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.[61]
<br>
<br>
        During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using
        its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat righting reflex.[62] A cat always
        rights itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm
        (3.0 ft) or more.[63] How cats are able to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the "falling
        cat problem".</p>
    <h2>Coats</h2>
    <h4><strong><em>Main article: <a href="indexTag.html" target="_blank">Local link in new tab</a></em></strong></h4>
    <p>The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring. The domestic cat genes MC1R
        and ASIP allow for the variety of color in coats. The feline ASIP gene consists of three coding exons.[65] Three
        novel microsatellite markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene and
        were used to perform linkage analysis in a pedigree of 89 domestic cats that segregated for melanism.</p>
